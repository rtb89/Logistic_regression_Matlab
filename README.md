# Logistic_regression_Matlab

Multinomial Logistic Regression with 10 fold cross validation on the accelerometer data and performance evaluation. 

This dataset has data from an accelerometer measuring 23,040 time periods with 8 features to predict an outcome. There are 8
features; The variable labels is 1 for the positive class (that we are trying to predict) and 0 for the negative
class.
The variable cvind is a random assignment of each data point into one of 10 buckets for a 10-fold cross-validation analysis
